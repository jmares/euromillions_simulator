# Euromillions Simulator

Python script that simulates millions of EuroMillions draws and keeps track of the frequency of combinations.

## Why?

After studying the chapters on lists, tuples and dictionaries from the book "*Python for Everybody*" by Charles Severance a couple of years ago, I wanted to create an exercise of my own.

## Caution!

This script is very processor and memory intensive. It can quickly go up to 100% use of your CPU and use so much RAM that it needs to start swapping.

## Disclaimer

No matter how many simulations you run, it will not increase your chances of winning EuroMillions. That is simply not how it works.

## To Do

- improve print output status
- variables for output status of drawings
- time needed for simulations (duration)
- better layout for the results
